# Install IBM Watson Text to Speech Library in OpenShift

IBM WatsonÂ® Text to Speech (TTS) enables you to convert written text into natural-sounding audio in a variety of languages and voices within an existing application or within Watson Assistant.

This tutorial walks you through the steps install a customizable TTS service in OpenShift. We will use [this](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-watson-embed-charts/tree/main/charts/ibm-watson-tts-embed) helm chart to deploy the service.

## Reference Architecture

![Diagram](architecture-tts.png)

## Prerequisites

- Install [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- Ensure you have an [entitlement key](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary). You may need to create one. This key is required to access [images](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-libraries?topic=i-accessing-files) used in this tutorial.
- Set an environment variable.

  ```sh
  export IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=<Set the entitlement key>
  ``` 
  
- S3 compatible storage. Below we give instructions on setting this up in IBM Cloud. For other clouds, use the instructions from the cloud provider.
- PostgreSQL Database is required to manage metadata related to customization
- An OpenShift Cluster on which you will deploy the service.

## S3 Compatible Storage

For customization, an S3 compatible storage service must exist that supports HMAC (access key and secret key) credentials. Watson Speech requires one bucket that it can read and write objects to. The bucket will be populated with stock models at install time and will also store customization artifacts, including training data and trained models.

### Create an S3 Bucket on IBM Cloud

Here are the steps to obtain IBM Cloud S3 bucket HMAC credentials and endpoint. You may choose bucket based on the cloud providers. 

1. Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/login).
2. From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click the Cloud Object Storage service instance that you want to work with.
3. To get the Bucket name, click `Buckets` in the left pane and select your preferred bucket name and make a note.
4. To get the endpoint URLs, click `Endpoint` in the left pane and select your preferred location or region.
   1. Copy your preferred public `endpoint` (for example, s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud) and use it as the value for the `Endpoint URL` field (or `endpointUrl` parameter).
   2. Copy your preferred location or `region` (for example, us-east) and use it as the value for the Region field (or region parameter).
5. To view the service credentials, click Service credentials in the left pane, and then click View credentials. (If you want to define new credentials, click New credential, click Advanced options, then select Include HMAC Credential.)
6. Copy the `cos_hmac_keys/secret_access_key` value and use it as the value for the `Secret access key` field (or `secretAccessKey parameter`).
7. Copy the `cos_hmac_keys/access_key_id` value and use it as the value for the `Access key ID` field (or `accessKeyId parameter`).

Set the S3 crededentials and information into the following environment variables. These variables will be used when deploying the TTS Helm chart.

```sh
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=<Bucket name you found in step 3 >
export S3_ENPOINT_URL=<Endpoint URL you found in step 4.1>
export S3_REGION=<Region can be found in step 4.2 when you select your bucket>
export S3_SECRET_KEY=<secretAccessKey you found in step 6>
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=<accessKeyId you found in step 7>
```

The commands you use to set the variables should look similar to the following.

```sh
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=speech-embed
export S3_REGION=us-east
export S3_ENPOINT_URL=https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud
export S3_SECRET_KEY=12a3bcd4567890ef123g4567890hij12k1m3n4567o8901p2
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=1a2dfbc3d45678901ef2g3h45678i90jkl
```

## Set PostgreSQL information in Environment Variables

A PostgreSQL database is required to manage metadata related to customization. The customization container uses TLS to Postgres, but always sets up the connection with a NonValidatingFactory which does not do certificate validation. 

Set the Database connection information into the following environment variables. These variables will be used when deploying the STT Helm chart.

```sh
export POSTGRES_HOST=<Postgresql hostname>
export POSTGRES_USER=<Postgresql username>
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<Postgresql password>
```

## Install Text to Speetch helm chart

Clone the Helm chart Github repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-watson-embed-charts.git
cd ibm-watson-embed-charts/charts
```

The containers deployed by this chart come from the IBM Entitled Registry. You must create a Secret with credentials to pull from this registry. The default name is `ibm-entitlement-key`, but this can be changed by updating the value of `imagePullSecrets`.

An example command to create the pull secret:

```sh
 oc create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key \
  --docker-server=cp.icr.io \
  --docker-username=cp \
  --docker-password=$IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY \
  --docker-email=<your-email>
```

> By default, the models that are enabled are en-US_MichaelV3Voice and en-US_AllisonV3Voice with defaultModel set to en-US_AllisonV3Voice.

Helm charts have configurable values that can be set at install time. To configure the install further, such as enabling additional models, Refer to the base values.yaml for documentation and defaults for the values. Values can be changed using `--set` or using YAML files specified with `-f/--values`. Here we are setting values using `--set` parameter

```sh
helm install tts-release ./ibm-watson-tts-embed \
--set license=true \
--set nameOverride=tts \
--set models.enUSTelephony.enabled=false \
--set postgres.host=${POSTGRES_HOST} \
--set postgres.user=${POSTGRES_USER} \
--set postgres.password=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} \
--set objectStorage.endpoint=${S3_ENPOINT_URL} \
--set objectStorage.region=${S3_REGION} \
--set objectStorage.bucket=${S3_BUCKET_NAME} \
--set objectStorage.accessKey=${S3_ACCESS_KEY} \
--set objectStorage.secretKey=${S3_SECRET_KEY}
```

## Verifying the chart

See the instruction (from NOTES.txt within chart) after the Helm installation completes for chart verification. The instruction can also be viewed by running the following command.

```sh
helm status tts-release
```

For basic usage of customization, see the customizing Watson Speech Library for Embed [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-libraries?topic=containers-customization-example).

The complete API reference for Watson Text-to-Speech can be found [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/text-to-speech).


## Use the service

In one terminal, create a proxy through the service:

```sh
oc proxy
```

In another terminal, view the list of voices:

```sh

curl --url "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/stt-demo/services/https:tts-release-runtime:https/proxy/text-to-speech/api/v1/voices"
```

Send a /synthesize request to generate speech and write out output.wav:

```sh
curl --url "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/stt-demo/services/https:tts-release-runtime:https/proxy/text-to-speech/api/v1/recognize?model=en-US_AllisonV3Voice" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"text":"Hello world"}' \
      --header "Accept: audio/wav" \
      --output output.wav
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall and delete the Text to Speech deployment, run the following command:

```sh

helm delete tts-release
```
