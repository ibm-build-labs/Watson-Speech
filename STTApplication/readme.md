# STT Client Application

In this tutorial you will build and run a Java Spring Boot web application that relies on Watson Speech-to-Text (STT) as a back-end service. The application code can be used as a starting point when developing your own speech application.

The application demonstrates two interfaces that a client program can use to leverage Watson STT.

- **REST interface.** This is used for batch processing, where the client sends audio files to the Watson STT and receives transcriptions synchronously.
- **WebSocket interface.** This can be used for streaming use cases, where the communication happens asynchronously.

In order to use this tutorial, you need to Run a Single-Container Speech-to-Text Service on Docker in your workstation. Please follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/ibm-ecosystem-engineering/Watson-Speech/tree/main/single-container-stt) to run the STT service.

## Architecture diagram

![Diagram](STTArchitectureLocal.png)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed
- [Java 17 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) is installed
- An STT Service running in a Docker container, as described [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecosystem-engineering/Watson-Speech/tree/main/single-container-stt)

## Get the sample code

Clone the following GitHub repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibm-ecosystem-engineerings/Watson-Speech
```

This repository contains code that is used in this tutorial.

## Steps

Follow the steps below to run the application front-end on your local machine,

### 1. Build

Go to the directory that contains sample code for this tutorial.

```sh
cd Watson-Speech/STTApplication
```

Run the build command.

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

The application will be packaged in JAR file `target/STTApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### 2. Run

Set the following environment variables. The Java application will use these to access the STT service from the Java application. Assume that your STT service is running on port 1080.

```sh
export STT_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=localhost:1080
```

To access the websocket streaming service

```sh
export STT_WSS_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:1080
```

Run the application.

```sh
java -jar target/STTApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application will listen on port 8080.

### 3. Test

Access the application in your browser with the following URL.

```sh
http://localhost:8080
```

## Understanding the Application Code

The Java [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application demonstrates use of both the STT batch (REST) API, as well as the streaming (WebSocket) API. It uses the REST API to send audio files to the SST service, and recieves in return transcripts of the audio. It uses the streaming API to perform live transcription of a user's voice.

[Feign](https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign) is used to wrap the REST calls. The relevant code appears in:

```sh
Watson-Speech/src/main/java/com/build/labs/feignclient/SSTServingClient.java
```

Here is the code fragment where the REST call is specified.

```java
@FeignClient(name = "fclient", url = "${client.post.baseurl}")
public interface SSTServingClient {

    public final String STT_REST_MAPPING = "/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize?model=en-US_Multimedia";

    @PostMapping(STT_REST_MAPPING)
    String transcript(@RequestBody byte[] body);
}
```

Here, `STT_REST_MAPPING` gives the API path. The `transcript` method accepts a single argument, that is audio input as byte format.

For streaming communication, the application uses Javascript to connect the client (browser) to the server. The code for this appears in:

```sh
Watson-Speech/STTApplication/src/main/resources/templates/index.html
```

Here is the fragment where the WebSocket channel is created.

```javascript
let webSocket = new WebSocket(websocketBaseUrl + "/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize");
```

Here is the code to send audio data to the server.

```javascript
const sendData = (webSocket, data) => {
  var message = {
    'action': 'start'
  };

  try {
    webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
    webSocket.send(data);
    webSocket.send(JSON.stringify({action: 'stop'}));
  } catch (exceptionVar) {

  }
}
```

Finally, here is the code that receives the transcript from server and displays it.

```javascript
webSocket.onmessage = function (event) {
  var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if(data.results !== undefined){
    data.results.forEach((element) => {
      element.alternatives.forEach((data) => {
        const divelement = document.getElementById("websocketResult");
        divelement.innerHTML = data.transcript;
      } )
    });
  }
};
```
